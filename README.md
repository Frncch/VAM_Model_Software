# VAM_Model_Software
A Matlab software platform for modelling vertically-integrated non-hydrostatic flows with moment equations

This software platform permits to compute depth-integrated non-hydrostatic open channel and coastal flows. The software is based on the Vertically-Averaged and Moment HOLAAaaaaaa (VAM) equations model. The VAM model uses the weighted residual method to account for the non-hydrostaticity and non-uniformity of flow.
